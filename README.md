# ARMInterviewWork

#To start the app, need to run - npm i to download packages

#Then run - node app

#Something I did not finish was the average rating of the movies, My approach would to store the rating as a Float in the database and then to round it to the nearest .5 with a helper function that can loop through an array of movie objects and round each one just for viewing.

#The db is stored on a free sql server that should work with the details provided in the solution.

#I would normally also have these details in a .env file however it did not seem necessary for this task.

#Thank you
